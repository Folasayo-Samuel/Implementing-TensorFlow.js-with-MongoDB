# Implementing-TensorFlow.js-with-MongoDB
## Implemented the connection between MongoDB and TensorFlow.js to facilitate machine learning operations. The commit includes schema definitions and data fetching routines from MongoDB, and model building, training, and evaluation using TensorFlow.js. Adjusted MongoDB data retrieval to create tensors directly usable by TensorFlow.js models.
